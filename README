Python tool to determine Makefile dependencies for a Fortran project.

Based heavily on: https://github.com/ZedThree/fort_depend.py

This version uses a very basic custom preprocessor written in Python; it
does not handle every possible directive. The most important directive that
it handles is conditional use statements. For example, conditionally
importing the module named "my_hooks" using a preprocessor directive
would look like this:

#ifdef USE_HOOKS
    use my_hooks
#endif

If the USE_HOOKS directive is defined, then this has important implications
for the Makefile dependencies.
