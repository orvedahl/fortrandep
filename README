Python tool to determine Makefile dependencies for a Fortran project.

Based heavily on: https://github.com/ZedThree/fort_depend.py

This version uses a very basic custom preprocessor written in Python; it
does not handle every possible directive. The most important directive that
it handles is conditional use statements, specifically ifdef and ifndef.
For example, conditionally importing the module named "my_hooks" using a
preprocessor directive would look like this:

#ifdef USE_HOOKS
    use my_hooks
#else
    use standard
#endif

If the USE_HOOKS directive is defined, then this has important implications
for the Makefile dependencies. Else clauses are supported, but else-if
statements are not.

The test/ directory contains a bunch of source tree variations and the
dependencies will be written to a file named <test dir>/depends.mak. This file
should be manually inspected to ensure proper handling of the specific test case.
There is no automated checking of the output, there are simply too many variations
to code. The 'PASS' that the python tester prints out, refers to the successful
completion/writing of the dependency file, not the accuracy of said file.
