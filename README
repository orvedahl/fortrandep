Python tool to determine Makefile dependencies for a Fortran project.

Main idea based on: https://github.com/ZedThree/fort_depend.py

Limitations:
	-all files are assumed to hold either modules or programs,
	 for example, files that contain only a subroutine definition
	 are not currently handled correctly.

	-preprocessor is very primitive; it cannot handle compounded/nested
	 directives, such as, ifdef statements that contain other ifdef
	 statements:
		#ifdef VAR1
		   #ifdef VAR2
		      <if VAR1 and VAR2>
		   #else
		      <if VAR1 and not VAR2>
		   #endif
		#endif
	 it also cannot handle include files that further include, e.g.,
		main file contains, #include file1
		and file1 contains, #include file2

	 The currently supported directives include:

	 if/else:
		#ifdef VARIABLE
		   <pure Fortran code, no other directives of any kind>
		#else
		   <pure Fortran code, no other directives of any kind>
		#endif

	 include:
		#include filename
		where filename contains pure Fortran code, no other directives

This version uses a very basic custom preprocessor written in Python; it
does not handle every possible directive. The most important directive that
it handles is conditional use statements, specifically ifdef and ifndef.
For example, conditionally importing the module named "my_hooks" using a
preprocessor directive would look like this:

#ifdef USE_HOOKS
    use my_hooks
#else
    use standard
#endif

If the USE_HOOKS directive is defined, then this has important implications
for the Makefile dependencies. Else clauses are supported, but else-if
statements are not.

The test/ directory contains a bunch of source tree variations and the
dependencies will be written to a file named <test dir>/depends.mak. This file
should be manually inspected to ensure proper handling of the specific test case.
There is no automated checking of the output, there are simply too many variations
to code. The 'PASS' that the python tester prints out, refers to the successful
completion/writing of the dependency file, not the accuracy of said file.
